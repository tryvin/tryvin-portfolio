Hello guys,

So, what all these words in my title has in common? Well, we could say pretty much nothing, but I don’t think so. All these worlds talk about getting something, and transforming this in another thing. We are talking about getting “raw data” as input, and sending something processed as output.

That’s all about my life, I’m a computer programmer, even so I prefer the term&nbsp;“tech solution developer”, and my thing is all about that bass (just kidding), I’m all about web and mobile, I like to know that I can push an update to everyone with a single Git commit to the server, and in the next refresh from the user, tadam, everything changed!

I’m a bit passionate about cars, travelling, and photographs. My friends use to say that I take more photos from everything else than from myself. I really like messing with the colors, and the way a photograph can show something. Instagram is my allied in that field. And my old LG G3 (the best lens on my opinion).

Well, on the other hand, I like to cook, I’m always amazed on how you can mix two things, and get another totally&nbsp;“superb”, which tastes just like your childhood.

And in this life, I learned how to write too, well, most fictional, but It’s still writing. I started my book, they say that every man to be a real man has to plant a tree, write a book, and have a child. I don’t know when it’s going to be done, but, someday I hope!

That’s all for a while, see you in the next post!
