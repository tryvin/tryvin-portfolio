What is this certification for?
==

The HIPAA Privacy & Security Training for Business Associates certifies that I'm capable of complying with the `Title I` of the HIPAA laws, regarding protection of patients' health data. Mainly the protection of the ePHI (Eletronic Protected Health Information), using from various technics as:

- Database data Encryption at Rest
- Users logs for auditing purposes
- Best practices to protect a "left open" system, expiring user sessions from time to time when there's no activity, preventing from a unauthorized user to use a user's account to grab information
- Implementing various user levels for access of information

That said, joining the previous knowledge I already have with securing systems, I'm able to keep your company HIPAA complaint.
