title = "HADOOP: MapReduce in Depth"

+++
In this course I confirmed my previous knowledge within a MapReduce pattern, I had previously worked with Map Reduce in other languages, such as Python, to introduce some data analysis, reading, and transforming unstructured data formats into a structured output.

Using Hadoop I may now implement this kind of development pattern in a fashion way, with various tools from Hadoop, like cluster support, Chaining of Mapper and Reducer jobs, multiple jobs chaining, distributed input files, scaling up to petabytes of Data.
