What is Scrum?
==

Scrum is an agile framework for managing knowledge work, with an emphasis on software development. It is designed for teams of three to nine members, who break their work into actions that can be completed within timeboxed iterations, called "sprints", no longer than one month and most commonly two weeks, then track progress and re-plan in 15-minute stand-up meetings, called daily scrums.

What is this certification for?
==

This certification is a confirmation of all my years working with Scrum teams, being a Scrum Master, and/or team member, attesting that I'm able to work in a Agile Team using Scrum Methodologies. Making the team evolve in a fast a paceful way, guaranteeing that the team is integrated and can participate and be heard with their issues and progress as the development evolves.

Being a Scrum Master I can work making the bridge between my team's concerns and blockers and the product owner, creating a politicized way of solving issues.

What is the next step?
==

Getting a Scrum.org certification, to complement my current certifications.
