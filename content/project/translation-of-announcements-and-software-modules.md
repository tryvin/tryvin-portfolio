+++
When I first met Linux I felt in love with the K Desktop Environment, and this love got me to the spirit of helping and community.

With small steps, I got into the Brazilian KDE community, and started translating the KDE Announcements from English to Brazilian Portuguese.

As soon as the official announcements were release, we had 1 hour tops to get them translated, so the project could start their own promotion.

With a focused mind, and a top-of-class management from the community we were able to accomplish this with a high success rate. Only behind from the original German writers.

After the announcements translation, my second step into helping the KDE community was translating the Qt modules, at the time I was developing with Qt into some personal projects, and this couldn't be the better opportunity to getting involved into the community, and learning more from the gran-masters.
