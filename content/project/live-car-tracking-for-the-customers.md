title = "Live Car Tracking for the Customers"

+++
Using PHP and Google Maps API I handled the integration with the proprietary car tracking system used by the staff.

Using ACLs to control what the clients were able to see, and which cars they were allowed to see, I arranged a nice and direct interface, so the clients could just login, choose their cars, and track them real time.

With this project I was able to reduce the number of phone calls to the customer central by 70%. As most of these calls were simple calls asking to track their own cars.
