What I have learned in a FastMBA?
==

The entire life cycle of a organization, being able to understand and address internal and external problems using of a out-of-the-box oriented thinking.

Together with the previous knowledge of Brazilian's accounting system, I could expand my horizons and confirm that I'm now able to take out your idea of the paper, and turn that into a structured plan, getting a killer `Bussiness Plan` ready, analysing all the good and bad points in your idea, and making the correct arrangements to turn that idea live with little to no launch friction.
